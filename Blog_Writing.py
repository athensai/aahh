                "**Before you stow your mower**: Did you know that gasoline has a shelf life? Yup, once it‚Äôs dispensed, if it‚Äôs left sitting too " \
                "long some of the hydrocarbons will evaporate, others will oxygenate, and a substance called gum begins " \
                "to form which is pretty much what it sounds like and you don‚Äôt want it in your engine. So either drain your " \
                "tank and lines before storing your mower or add some fuel stabilizer to the tank so it can overwinter safely." \
                "**One step for beautiful moss**: If you have hard soil in a shady area where grass won‚Äôt grow, one option is to let the moss take over. " \
                "It‚Äôs pretty, requires no fertilizer, and is resistant to pests. But if you go this route, one step you need to take is to keep the leaves " \
                "off in autumn. You can give it a pass with a bagging mower, or spend an afternoon getting some exercise by breaking out the rake."\
                "**Get your flue shot**: Don‚Äôt wait until it‚Äôs time to build a fire in your fireplace or wood stove ‚Äî have your flue inspected now. " \
                "There‚Äôs no other way to know if you have a dangerous buildup of creosote in your flue (which can ignite at just over 450 degrees) or " \
                "blockages from bird nests or debris. More than 25,000 chimney fires are set off every year in the US, causing over $100 million in property " \
                "damage and around 500 deaths. So be safe and have your flue checked, and cleaned if necessary, before you light that first fire of the season."
